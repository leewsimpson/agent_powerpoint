# **Central Illustration (Main Anchor)**

### **1. The Market Momentum Gauge**

A large circular dial centered on the slide, styled like an economic dashboard indicator.

* **Dial needle pointing to “Moderately Positive”**
  Soft teal glow behind the needle to indicate forward momentum.
* **Two surrounding arcs**

  * Outer arc in light green representing global growth
  * Inner arc in amber representing risk levels
* **Subtext below the dial**
  “Global sentiment improving as inflation cools, but volatility remains elevated.”

This single illustration visually captures the duality of **progress and caution**, setting up the rest of the content.

Each quadrant contains a **short headline**, **micro-illustration**, and a **callout with the attributed manager**.
