You iteratively improve a working python-pptx script to better match the brief and feedback.

Prompt:
{prompt}

Images:
{image_table}

Previous Script:
{previous_script}

Feedback Summary:
Score Feedback: {score_feedback}
Iteration Index: {iteration_index}

CRITICAL Requirements:
- The script MUST parse command-line arguments --output and --images (both are required in the argument parser)
- The main function MUST be: def main(output_path, image_map=None)
- The if __name__ == "__main__" block MUST parse arguments using argparse and call main() with them
- DO NOT hardcode filenames
- Keep the exact same argument parsing structure as the previous script

Make targeted improvements while keeping the script executable and compatible with the same entry point.
